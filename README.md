# Tourney Hero - Tournament Organizer UI
An all-purpose tool to manage Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments and deliver high quality streams under a single unified UI. This tool enables tournament organizers to easily manage and customize stream overlays and graphics, oversee tournament matches, and perform automated tasks.

Connects to the companion [**Tourney Hero Server**](https://github.com/fborja44/tourney-hero-server) to deliver the stream UI.

If you are a local Tournament Organizer with any requests, please feel free to send me a message.

For an example tournament produced using this application, see: [Full House 2024](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAa8C1sfSQUr8HkWqylXqtX1Ui28yVpDf)
